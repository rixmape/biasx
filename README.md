# BiasX

BiasX is a Python library for detecting and explaining gender bias in face classification models. This repository provides a toolkit to analyze bias through both traditional fairness metrics and feature-level analysis. Visual heatmaps and quantitative bias scores are generated to help developers understand which facial features contribute to biased classifications.
